## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* What do LIFO and FIFO mean
* What is a stack, and when to use it
* What is a queue, and when to use it
* What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
* What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
* What is the proper way to use global variables

---

### [0. push]
* Pushes an element to the stack(./1000-holberton.bf)

### [0.1 pall]
* Prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top of the stack

### [1. pint](./1001-add.bf)
* Prints the value at the top of the stack


### [2. pop](./1002-mul.bf)
* Removes the top element of the stack


### [3. swap](./1003-mul.bf)
* Swaps the top two elements of the stack

### [4. add]
* Adds the top two elements of the stack

### [5. nop]
* Doesn't do anything

### [6. sub]
* Subtracts the top element of the stack from the second top one

### [7. div]
* Divides the second top element of the stack by the top element 

### [8. mul]
* Multiplies the second top element of the stack with the top one

### [9. mod]
* Computes the rest of the division of the second top element by the top one

### [10. pchar]
* Prints the chat at the top of the stack

### [11. pstr]
* Prints the string starting at the top of the stack

### [12. rotl]
* Rotates the stack to the top

### [13. rotr]
* Rotates the stack to the bottom

### [14. stack]
